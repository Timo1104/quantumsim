:mod:`quantumsim.models` -- models of quantum operations
========================================================

This is a temporary module, after introduction of a proper high-level
interface it will be removed or heavily refactored. If you use functions from
this module, you depend strictly on `quantumsim<1.1`. Also, this module must
be imported explicitly, `import quantumsim` does not include it for the sake
of future compatibility.
