We define the bell state preparation circuit and the ZZ and XX parity-check circuits. Importantly for these cirucits is the use of conditional rotation. For the bell-state preparation, a 90 degree rotation is applied to the second data qubit only in the ZZ-experiment, but not in the XX-experiment. Conditional feedback rotation are also used in the ZZ and XX parity check circuits to implement a conditional reset operation, based on the measurement outcome of the ancilla."
